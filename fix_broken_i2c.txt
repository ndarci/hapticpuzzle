the problem: i2c throws a bunch of errors then stops working, can't even see devices with i2cdetect and it takes forever (times out on every request)
in bash...

i2cdetect -y 1      // verify this runs slow and has no addresses

* unplug breadboard

pinctrl             // verify SCL pin is low
pinctrl set 3 op    // set SCL as output
pinctrl set 3 pu    // set pullup resistor on SCL pin
pinctrl set 3 a0    // reset SCL to i2c pin 
pinctrl             // verify SCL pin is high now

* plug breadboard back in

i2cdetect -y 1      // verify this runs fast and has all your addresses
